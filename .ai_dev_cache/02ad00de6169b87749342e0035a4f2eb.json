However, I propose introducing a dynamic risk management system within the ensemble method. This system could monitor market conditions in real-time and adjust trading parameters dynamically to mitigate risks. For instance, during high volatility, it could reduce exposure to certain assets or tighten stop-loss orders.\n\nAdditionally, incorporating a sentiment analysis component into AI models can help gauge market情绪 more accurately. Sentiment data from social media, news articles, and analyst reports can provide valuable insights that traditional models might miss. This holistic approach would enable the trading strategy to react not only to numerical data but also to underlying market sentiments, enhancing its responsiveness and effectiveness.\n\nBy integrating a dynamic risk management system and sentiment analysis into ensemble methods, we can create more sophisticated and adaptive trading strategies for PETR4 that are better equipped to handle market uncertainties and make informed decisions based on comprehensive insights.", "timestamp": 1741803428.4946153}
