FiveM is a modded version of Grand Theft Auto V that allows players to customize and interact within a multiplayer environment. If you're looking to create scripts for FiveM, they are typically written in Lua or C#. Below, I'll provide an example of a simple Lua script for FiveM that creates a basic interaction command.\n\n### Example: Creating a Simple Interaction Command\n\nThis script will add a custom command (`/hello`) that players can use in-game. When the command is executed, it will display a message to all other players around the user.\n\n1. **Create the `__resource.lua` File**:\n   This file tells FiveM what files are part of your resource.\n\n```lua\n-- __resource.lua\nresource_manifest_version '44febabe-d386-4d18-afbe-5e627f4af937'\n\nclient_script 'cl_hello.lua'\n```\n\n2. **Create the `cl_hello.lua` File**:\n   This is where the actual command logic will be implemented.\n\n```lua\n-- cl_hello.lua\n\nRegisterCommand('hello', function(source, args, rawCommand)\n    -- Get the name of the player who executed the command\n    local playerName = GetPlayerName(PlayerId())\n    \n    -- Send a chat message to all players around the executor\n    TriggerEvent('chat:addMessage', {\n        color = {255, 0, 0},\n        multiline = true,\n        args = {\"System\", \"Hello! \" .. playerName .. \" just said hi!\"}\n    })\nend)\n```\n\n### How to Use This Script\n\n1. **Create a Resource Directory**:\n   Create a new folder in your FiveM resources directory (e.g., `resources/my_hello_script`).\n\n2. **Add the Files**:\n   Place the `__resource.lua` and `cl_hello.lua` files inside this folder.\n\n3. **Update Server Config**:\n   Add your script to the server configuration file (`server.cfg`). For example, add the following line:\n\n```lua\nstart my_hello_script\n```\n\n4. **Start Your FiveM Server**:\n   Launch your FiveM server, and you should be able to use the `/hello` command in-game.\n\n### Customization\n\nYou can customize this script by adding more commands or changing how messages are displayed. For example, you could create a command that teleports players to specific locations or changes their skin.\n\nIf you need help with more complex scripts or have any questions about FiveM scripting, feel free to ask!", "timestamp": 1741793026.2270744}
