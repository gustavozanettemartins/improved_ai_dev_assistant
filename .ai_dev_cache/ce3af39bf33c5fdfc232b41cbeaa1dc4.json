Since `main.py` primarily initializes and runs the Tkinter application, we will focus on testing the initialization process and ensuring that the main window is set up correctly.\n\nHere's the complete implementation of `test_main.py`:\n\n```python\nimport unittest\nfrom unittest.mock import patch\nimport tkinter as tk\nfrom main import main\n\nclass TestMain(unittest.TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Set up a fresh environment before each test.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.root = tk.Tk()\n\n    def tearDown(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Clean up the Tkinter root window after each test.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.root.destroy()\n\n    @patch('main.CalculatorUI')\n    def test_main_initialization(self, mock_calculator_ui):\n        \"\"\"\n        Test that main initializes the CalculatorUI with the correct arguments and starts the Tkinter event loop.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Call the main function\n        main()\n\n        # Check if CalculatorUI was called with the root window as an argument\n        mock_calculator_ui.assert_called_once_with(self.root)\n\n        # Since we are not actually running the Tkinter event loop in this test,\n        # we do not need to check for root.mainloop() being called.\n\n    @patch('main.CalculatorUI')\n    def test_main_window_properties(self, mock_calculator_ui):\n        \"\"\"\n        Test that the main window has the correct title and geometry.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Call the main function\n        main()\n\n        # Check the title of the main window\n        self.assertEqual(self.root.title(), \"Simple Calculator\")\n\n        # Check the geometry of the main window\n        self.assertEqual(self.root.geometry(), \"300x400\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    unittest.main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Class `TestMain`:**\n  - Inherits from `unittest.TestCase`.\n  - Contains multiple test methods to cover different aspects of the `main` function.\n\n- **Method `setUp`:**\n  - Creates a new Tkinter root window before each test method runs.\n  \n- **Method `tearDown`:**\n  - Destroys the Tkinter root window after each test method runs to ensure that tests are isolated from each other.\n\n- **Test Methods:**\n\n  - **`test_main_initialization`:**\n    - Uses `unittest.mock.patch` to mock the `CalculatorUI` class.\n    - Calls the `main` function and checks if `CalculatorUI` was initialized with the correct root window as an argument.\n  \n  - **`test_main_window_properties`:**\n    - Again, uses `unittest.mock.patch` to mock the `CalculatorUI` class (not strictly necessary here but kept for consistency).\n    - Calls the `main` function and checks if the main window has the correct title (`\"Simple Calculator\"`) and geometry (`\"300x400\"`).\n\n### Running the Tests\n\n1. Save the above code in a file named `test_main.py`.\n2. Ensure that your `main.py`, `ui.py`, and `calculator.py` files are in the same directory as `test_main.py`.\n3. Run the tests using the following command:\n   ```bash\n   python test_main.py\n   ```\n\nThis will execute all the test methods and provide feedback on which tests pass or fail, helping you ensure that your main application initialization works correctly.\n\n### Note\n\n- The `unittest` framework does not support testing Tkinter event loops directly in a unit test. If you need to test more complex interactions within the UI, consider using a tool like `pytest` with `pytest-tk` or `tkinter-testing`. However, for basic setup and initialization tests, this approach should suffice.", "timestamp": 1741793550.6417933}
